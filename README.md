# What to know about Blackjack
*Achieve Blackjack:You can achieve when the first two cards dealt to you are an Ace and a face card (Jack, Queen, King) Which leads to an instant WIN, unless the dealer also draws a Blackjack, it will be "Push" 

* Simple Blackjack Terms : Bust, Hit, and stand. The term "Bust" is simply a Blackjack term meaning exceeding 21 and you lost. "Hit" is what you want to click (or say if playing in person) to add another card, which increases your total value and "Stand" is declaring your turn to be over and that you no longer want to add cards to your total 

* Try to have a higher Value than Dealer: If your hand total is/or closer to 21 and is a higher value the dealer's hand , you Win.

* _Remember_ : The Goal of Blackjack is to achieve a total of 21 or Blackjack through the card values without going over 21 or having a lower value than dealer hand. Going over 21 results in an automatic loss!

            <h2>How to Play & What to Know!</h2>
            <p><strong>THE GOAL</strong> of Blackjack is to achieve a total of 21 or Blackjack through the card values without going over 21. Going over 21 results in an automatic loss!</p>
            
            <p><strong>START GAME</strong> - Place your bet amount, and both the Player and Dealer will receive 2 cards each.</p>
            
            <p><strong>PLAYER'S HAND</strong> - You will receive 2 cards face up.</p>
            
            <p><strong>DEALER'S HAND</strong> - The Dealer will have 1 card face up and 1 card face down.</p>
            
            <p><strong>CHOICES</strong> - Choose whether to Hit (add a card) or Stand (end your turn and keep your current hand).</p>
            
            <p><strong>END TURN</strong> - Once you stand, the Dealer will reveal their hidden card and play their turn.</p>
            
            <p><strong>WINNER</strong> - The winner is whoever has Blackjack, a total closer to 21, or does not go over 21 (Ace plus a 10 is an automatic Blackjack).</p>
            
            <p><strong>TIE GAME</strong> - If both players have the same total, including 21, it is a Push (Tie Game). No winner!</p>
            
            <p><strong>CARD VALUES</strong> - Number cards hold their face value, and Face cards (J, Q, K) are worth 10.</p>
            
            <p><strong>AND REMEMBER</strong> - If you decide to gamble, please do so responsibly. Donâ€™t let gambling control you. If you need help, call 1-800-GAMBLER.</p>
